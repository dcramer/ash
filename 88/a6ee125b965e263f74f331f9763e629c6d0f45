Keep it minimal—agents are capable and don't need hand-holding.\n\n## File Setup\n\n1. Create `AGENTS.md` at project root\n2. Create symlink: `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`\n\n## Before Writing\n\nDiscover local skills to reference:\n\n```bash\nfind .claude/skills -name \"SKILL.md\" 2>/dev/null\nls plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nRead each skill's frontmatter to understand when to reference it.\n\n## Writing Rules\n\n- **Headers + bullets** - No paragraphs\n- **Code blocks** - For commands and templates\n- **Reference, don't duplicate** - Point to skills: \"Use `db-migrate` skill. See `.claude/skills/db-migrate/SKILL.md`\"\n- **No filler** - No intros, conclusions, or pleasantries\n- **Trust capabilities** - Omit obvious context\n\n## Required Sections\n\n### Package Manager\nWhich tool and key commands only:\n```markdown\n## Package Manager\nUse **pnpm**: `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm test`\n```\n\n### Commit Attribution\nAlways include this section. Agents should use their own identity:\n```markdown\n## Commit Attribution\nAI commits MUST include:\n```\nCo-Authored-By: (the agent model's name and attribution byline)\n```\nExample: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4 <noreply@example.com>`\n```\n\n### Key Conventions\nProject-specific patterns agents must follow. Keep brief.\n\n### Local Skills\nReference each discovered skill:\n```markdown\n## Database\nUse `db-migrate` skill for schema changes. See `.claude/skills/db-migrate/SKILL.md`\n\n## Testing\nUse `write-tests` skill. See `.claude/skills/write-tests/SKILL.md`\n```\n\n## Optional Sections\n\nAdd only if truly needed:\n- API route patterns (show template, not explanation)\n- CLI commands (table format)\n- File naming conventions\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\nOmit these:\n- \"Welcome to...\" or \"This document explains...\"\n- \"You should...\" or \"Remember to...\"\n- Content duplicated from skills (reference instead)\n- Obvious instructions (\"run tests\", \"write clean code\")\n- Explanations of why (just say what)\n- Long prose paragraphs\n\n## Example Structure\n\n```markdown\n# Agent Instructions\n\n## Package Manager\nUse **pnpm**: `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`\n\n## Commit Attribution\nAI commits MUST include:\n```\nCo-Authored-By: (the agent model's name and attribution byline)\n```\n\n## API Routes\n[Template code block]\n\n## Database\nUse `db-migrate` skill. See `.claude/skills/db-migrate/SKILL.md`\n\n## Testing\nUse `write-tests` skill. See `.claude/skills/write-tests/SKILL.md`\n\n## CLI\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `pnpm cli sync` | Sync data |\n```\n",
