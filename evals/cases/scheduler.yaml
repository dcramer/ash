    prompt: "Set up a daily standup reminder at 10am EST on weekdays. Also remind me about my dentist appointment this Saturday at 2pm."
    expected_behavior: |
      The assistant should handle both requests in a single turn:
      1. A recurring weekday reminder at 10am EST for standup
      2. A one-off reminder for Saturday at 2pm for the dentist

      It should use scheduling tools and confirm both reminders with
      their respective times and recurrence patterns.
    criteria:
      - Acknowledges the recurring standup reminder (weekdays at 10am EST)
      - Acknowledges the one-off dentist reminder (Saturday at 2pm)
      - Handles the EST timezone specification
      - Distinguishes between recurring and one-off scheduling
      - Provides confirmation of both reminders
