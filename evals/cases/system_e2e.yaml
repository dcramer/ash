        criteria:
          - Confirms a recurring schedule/reminder was created
          - Includes timing details in the response

      - prompt: "What do I need to do today, and what reminder is set?"

        expected_behavior: |
          The assistant should make a browser attempt and report the actual outcome
          without guessing or fabricating success.
        criteria:
          - Attempts a browser tool call
          - Reports observed tool outcome honestly (success or explicit error)
          - Does not fabricate page results if browser action fails

    description: Telegram replies should cite skill provenance inline when a skill informs output
    expected_tools:
      - use_skill
    turns:
      - prompt: "First call use_skill with skill='daily-brief' and message='run the brief now'. Then return the brief in one short sentence."
        expected_behavior: |
          The assistant should invoke the eval dummy skill and include concise inline
          provenance in the final user-visible response.
        criteria:
          - Uses the daily-brief skill to inform the reply
          - Includes inline provenance mentioning /daily-brief in the final response text

            memory_type: knowledge
            sensitivity: public
            portable: true
    turns:
      - prompt: "I asked 'what's the weather'. Do not fetch live weather. Just tell me which city you'd use based on memory, then ask if I want you to fetch current conditions."
        expected_behavior: |
          The assistant should recover remembered location context and use it to
          ground the response, without requiring immediate city/zip clarification.
        criteria:
          - Uses remembered location context from memory (San Francisco)
          - Does not claim it fetched current weather
          - Asks for confirmation or permission before any live fetch
