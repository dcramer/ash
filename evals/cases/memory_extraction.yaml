    description: Remember X is my Y should use memory extract to store a relationship memory
    prompt: "Remember that Sarah is my sister"
    expected_behavior: |
      The agent should use `ash-sb memory extract` (not memory add) to store
      the fact that Sarah is the user's sister. The resulting memory should have
      type=relationship and be linked to a person named Sarah.
    criteria:
      - The agent runs ash-sb memory extract
      - A memory about Sarah being the user's sister is stored
      - The memory has relationship type (not knowledge or identity)
      - A person record for Sarah exists
    expected_tools:
      - bash
    assertions:
      memories:
        - content_contains: [sarah, sister]
          memory_type: relationship

  - id: extraction_preference_stored
    description: Remember I prefer X should use memory extract to store a preference memory
    prompt: "Remember that I prefer dark mode in all apps"
    expected_behavior: |
      The agent should use `ash-sb memory extract` (not memory add) to store
      a preference-typed memory about the user preferring dark mode.
    criteria:
      - The agent runs ash-sb memory extract
      - A memory about dark mode preference is stored
      - The memory has preference type
    expected_tools:
      - bash
    assertions:
      memories:
        - content_contains: [dark mode]
          memory_type: preference

        messages:
          - "Remember that Sarah is my sister"
        drain_extraction: true
    prompt: "What do you know about my sister?"
    expected_behavior: |
      The agent should recall that the user's sister is Sarah, based on the
      memory stored from a previous explicit "remember" request. The response
      should mention Sarah by name.
    criteria:
      - Mentions Sarah by name
      - Identifies Sarah as the user's sister
      - Response is conversational
    tags:
      - memory
      - recall
