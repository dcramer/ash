Skills can have their own configuration sections for API keys and settings.

## Configuration

```toml
[skills.weather]
api_key = "abc123"
units = "metric"

[skills.calendar]
default_timezone = "America/New_York"
```

## Format

Each skill gets its own `[skills.<name>]` section:

```toml
[skills.<skill-name>]
key = "value"
another_key = "another value"
```

## Example: Weather Skill

```toml
[skills.weather]
api_key = "your-openweather-api-key"
units = "metric"
default_location = "New York, NY"
```

The skill accesses these values when invoked.

## Skill Discovery

Skills are loaded from:

1. `~/.ash/workspace/skills/` - User skills
2. Built-in skills bundled with Ash

## Accessing Config in Skills

Skills receive their config section when executed. A skill named `weather` receives values from `[skills.weather]`.
