The workspace directory contains files that define your assistant's personality.

## Configuration

```toml
workspace = "~/.ash/workspace"
```

## Workspace Structure

```
~/.ash/workspace/
├── SOUL.md      # Assistant personality
└── skills/      # Custom skills
```

## SOUL.md

Defines your assistant's personality, behavior, and capabilities:

```markdown
# Ash

You are a personal assistant named Ash.

## Personality

- Helpful and direct
- Technical but accessible

```markdown
# User Profile

## Creating the Workspace

The workspace is created automatically when you first run Ash. You can also create it manually:

```

Then create `SOUL.md` with your assistant's personality.

## Skills Directory

```
~/.ash/workspace/skills/
├── weather/

└── deploy/
    └── SKILL.md
```
