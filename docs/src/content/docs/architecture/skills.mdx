Skills provide configurable, workspace-defined capabilities that extend the agent.

## Skill Definition

Skills are defined in YAML files in the workspace:

```yaml
# ~/.ash/workspace/skills/weather.yaml
name: weather
description: Get weather information for locations
requirements:
  bins:
    - curl
  env:
    - WEATHER_API_KEY
inputs:
  location:
    type: string
    description: Location to get weather for
    required: true
  units:
    type: string
    description: Temperature units
    default: metric
script: |
  curl -s "https://api.weather.com/v1?q=$location&units=$units" \
    -H "Authorization: $WEATHER_API_KEY"
```

## Skill Structure

Location: `src/ash/skills/base.py`

```python
class SkillDefinition:
    name: str
    description: str
    requirements: SkillRequirements
    inputs: dict[str, SkillInput]
    script: str
    config: dict[str, str]  # From [skills.name] config section
```

### Requirements

Skills can specify requirements:

```yaml
requirements:
  bins:           # Required binaries
    - curl
    - jq
  env:            # Required environment variables
    - API_KEY
  os:             # OS constraints
    - linux
    - darwin
```

### Inputs

Input parameters are validated:

```yaml
inputs:
  query:
    type: string
    description: Search query
    required: true
  limit:
    type: integer
    description: Maximum results
    default: 10
```

## Skill Registry

Location: `src/ash/skills/registry.py`

Skills are discovered from the workspace:

```python
registry = SkillRegistry(workspace_path)
await registry.discover()

skill = registry.get("weather")
```

## Skill Execution

Location: `src/ash/skills/executor.py`

Skills are executed in the sandbox:

```python
class SkillExecutor:
    async def execute(
        self,
        skill: SkillDefinition,
        inputs: dict,
        context: ToolContext,
    ) -> ToolResult:
        # Validate inputs
        # Inject config values
        # Execute script in sandbox
```

## Configuration

Skills receive config from `[skills.<name>]`:

```toml
[skills.weather]
api_key = "abc123"
units = "metric"
```

Access in script via environment:

```yaml
script: |
  curl "https://api.weather.com?key=$api_key&units=$units"
```

## Bundled Skills

Location: `src/ash/skills/bundled/`

Pre-defined skills included with Ash.

## Creating Skills

1. Create YAML file in `~/.ash/workspace/skills/`
2. Define name, description, and inputs
3. Write script using bash
4. Add config section if needed

Skills appear as tools to the LLM.
