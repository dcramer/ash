Ash todos are graph-native records intended for reliable task tracking.

## What It Provides

- Canonical todo lifecycle: `open`, `done`, soft delete
- Personal scope (owned by user) and shared scope (scoped to chat)
- Optional reminder linkage to scheduler entries

## Graph Storage

Todos are stored in `~/.ash/graph/` as registered graph collections:

- `todos.jsonl` (`todo` node type)
- `todo_events.jsonl` (`todo_event` node type)
- `edges.jsonl` (`TODO_OWNED_BY`, `TODO_SHARED_IN` edges)

This keeps todo data in the same extensible graph storage model used by other Ash entities.

## Runtime Surfaces

Todo integration owns:

- RPC methods (`todo.create`, `todo.list`, `todo.update`, etc.)
- Sandbox CLI commands (`ash-sb todo ...`)
- Prompt routing guidance for canonical task operations

Reminder linking is internal to the todo subsystem. Public clients use `todo.update`
reminder fields (for example via `ash-sb todo remind` / `ash-sb todo unremind`)
rather than dedicated link/unlink RPC methods.

## Configuration

Enable or disable the subsystem in `~/.ash/config.toml`:

```toml
[todo]
enabled = true
```

When disabled, todo integration is not composed into runtime hooks, and todo RPC/CLI surfaces are unavailable.
