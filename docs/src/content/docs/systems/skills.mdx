Skills are reusable instruction files that teach Ash how to run a workflow. A skill is instructions, context, and optional helper files. It is not a compiled plugin.

## Skills In 30 Seconds

Use a skill when you want Ash to repeat a workflow reliably:

- Multi-step tasks with specific order.
- Domain-specific behavior (for example, your team’s deploy playbook).
- Guardrails around which tools are allowed.
- Subagent execution with isolated iterations and context.

When a skill is used:

1. Ash reads `SKILL.md`.
2. Ash launches a skill subagent from that definition.
3. The skill subagent runs its own tool-and-LLM loop.
4. Ash returns results as part of the normal conversation.

## Where Skills Should Live

Use **workspace skills** as the default for anything project-specific.

Canonical location:

```text
~/.ash/workspace/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Inside the sandbox runtime, that same directory appears at:

```text
/workspace/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Other skill types:

1. Built-in skills: shipped with Ash.
2. Installed skills: added from external repos or local sources.

Precedence when names collide: workspace > installed > built-in.

Built-in skills are packaged source skills (not a separate plugin model). They use
the same `SKILL.md` contract and runtime behavior as installed/workspace skills.
In this repo, they live at:

```text
src/ash/skills/bundled/
```

See:

- `src/ash/skills/bundled/README.md`

## Create Your First Skill

```bash
# 1) Scaffold a new skill folder in workspace
ash skill init my-skill --resources scripts,references

# 2) Edit the generated instructions
$EDITOR ~/.ash/workspace/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# 3) Validate format and frontmatter
ash skill validate ~/.ash/workspace/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# 4) Confirm it's discoverable
ash skill list --source
```

Generated directory shape:

<FileTree>
- my-skill/
  - SKILL.md Required: main instructions
  - scripts/ Optional: helper scripts
  - references/ Optional: longer docs for context
  - assets/ Optional: extra files
</FileTree>

## SKILL.md Template

Use this as your starting point:

```markdown
---
# Required. One-line summary shown when Ash considers this skill.
description: Triages GitHub issues for a repo

# Optional. Override displayed name (default: folder name).
name: github-triage

# Optional. Restrict tools this skill can call (empty = all available).
allowed_tools:
  - bash
  - web_fetch

# Optional. Environment variable names read from config [skills.github-triage].
env:
  - GITHUB_TOKEN

# Optional. Model alias override for this skill only.
model: haiku

# Optional. Iteration limit for this skill (default: 10).
max_iterations: 10
---

## Instructions

When asked to triage issues:

1. Fetch issues from GitHub API.
2. Summarize priority, owner, and next action.
3. Return a concise markdown report.

## Notes

- Prefer open issues unless asked otherwise.
- Flag blocked items explicitly.
```

## Install And Manage External Skills

Use this when you want shared/community skill packs:

```bash
# Add a source from GitHub
ash skill add anthropic/skills

# Add a pinned version
ash skill add anthropic/skills@v1.0.0

# Add from a local path
ash skill add ~/my-local-skills

# See configured sources
ash skill sources

# Sync latest from configured sources
ash skill sync

# Update installed repos to latest refs
ash skill update

# Remove a configured source
ash skill remove anthropic/skills
```

## Configure Skills

Global skill behavior in `config.toml`:

```toml
[skills]
auto_sync = true             # Optional bool. Default: false.
update_interval_minutes = 5  # Optional int. Default: 5.
```

External source declarations:

```toml
[[skills.sources]]
repo = "anthropic/skills"      # owner/repo source

[[skills.sources]]
repo = "company/internal-skills"
ref = "v2.0.0"                 # optional branch/tag/commit pin

[[skills.sources]]
path = "~/my-local-skills"     # local source path
# Set exactly one of: repo or path.
```

Per-skill overrides:

```toml
[skills.github-triage]
enabled = true                  # Optional bool. Default: true.
model = "haiku"                 # Optional model override.
GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_..."        # Unknown keys become env vars.
MAX_RESULTS = "25"              # Also exposed as env var.
```

Global and per-skill chat allowlists:

```toml
[skills.defaults]
allow_chat_ids = ["12345"]      # Optional global default allowlist

[skills.github-triage]
allow_chat_ids = ["12345"]      # Optional per-skill override
```

<Aside type="note">
  Per-skill env keys are passed to the skill and uppercased automatically (for example, `gh_token` becomes `GH_TOKEN`).
</Aside>

## Capability-Backed Skills (Sensitive Integrations)

For email/calendar and similar sensitive systems, skills should call
`ash-sb capability` and declare required capability IDs in frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: Manage inbox and calendar through host-managed capabilities
sensitive: true
access:
  chat_types:
    - private
capabilities:
  - gog.email
  - gog.calendar
allowed_tools:
  - bash
---
```

Provider runtime wiring is host-owned configuration, not skill metadata:

```toml
[skills.gog]
enabled = true

[skills.gog.capability_provider]
enabled = true
namespace = "gog"
command = ["gogcli", "bridge"]
timeout_seconds = 30
```

## Bundled Optional `gog` Skill

Ash includes an opt-in bundled `gog` skill for dogfooding this contract.

Enable it in `config.toml`:

[skills.gog]
enabled = true

[skills.gog.capability_provider]
enabled = true
namespace = "gog"
command = ["gogcli", "bridge"]
timeout_seconds = 30
```

When `skills.gog.enabled = true`, Ash auto-wires default
`capabilities.providers.gog` settings unless overridden explicitly.

## Troubleshooting

### Skill does not appear

```bash
# Confirm Ash can discover it
ash skill list --source

# Validate the file directly
ash skill validate ~/.ash/workspace/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

### Skill is present but inactive

```toml
[skills.my-skill]
enabled = true
```

### External source is stale or missing updates

```bash
ash skill sources
ash skill sync
ash skill update
```

### Repo source fails with git errors

Install git for your platform and retry:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
apt install git

# macOS
brew install git
```

## Reference (Advanced)

Storage layout under `~/.ash/`:

```text
~/.ash/
├── config.toml
├── skills/                    # User skills
├── skills.installed/          # External skill sources
│   ├── .sources.json
│   ├── .sync_state.json
│   ├── github/
│   └── local/
└── workspace/
    └── skills/                # Project/workspace skills
```

Internally, discovery is handled by `src/ash/skills/registry.py` and source metadata tracks built-in, installed, user, and workspace origins.
