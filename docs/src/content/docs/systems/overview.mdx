Ash is built from modular systems. Use this page to jump straight to the subsystem you need.

## Systems In 30 Seconds

- **LLM Providers** choose models and credentials
- **Tools** execute actions (shell, web, files, browser, delegation)
- **Skills** define reusable workflows in `SKILL.md`
- **Agents** run delegated autonomous loops
- **Memory** keeps context and extracted facts
- **Sandbox** isolates command execution
- **Providers** deliver messages (for example Telegram)
- **Vision** analyzes inbound images
- **Browser** performs session-based page automation

## Start By Goal

If you want to:

- Configure model aliases and API keys -> [LLM Providers](/systems/llm/)
- Understand or extend tool behavior -> [Tools](/systems/tools/)
- Create reusable workflows -> [Skills](/systems/skills/)
- Configure delegated agent execution -> [Agents](/systems/agents/)
- Tune context and extraction quality -> [Memory](/systems/memory/)
- Harden runtime security -> [Sandbox](/systems/sandbox/)
- Configure Telegram delivery/runtime -> [Providers](/systems/providers/)
- Enable image understanding -> [Vision](/systems/vision/)
- Run browser automation -> [Browser](/systems/browser/)

## Troubleshooting

If subsystem behavior is unclear or seems broken:

```bash
uv run ash doctor
uv run ash config validate
```

Then check the specific subsystem page linked above for targeted diagnostics.

## Reference (Advanced)
