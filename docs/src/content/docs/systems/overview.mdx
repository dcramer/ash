Ash is built from modular systems. This page gives you one baseline config and a map to the right subsystem doc for each task.

## Systems In 30 Seconds

- **Models** define model aliases, provider choice, and credentials
- **Tools** execute actions (shell, web, files, browser, delegation)
- **Skills** define reusable subagent workflows in `SKILL.md`
- **Agents** run delegated autonomous loops (including nested execution)
- **Memory** controls context retention and extraction quality
- **Sandbox** enforces runtime isolation and file/network boundaries
- **Chat Providers** connect Ash to channels like Telegram
- **Vision** processes inbound images and injects context
- **Browser** runs session-based page actions

## Core Config Baseline

Start with a minimal working `~/.ash/config.toml`:

```toml title="~/.ash/config.toml"
[models.default]
provider = "openai-oauth"
model = "gpt-5.2"
max_tokens = 4096

[models.mini]
provider = "openai-oauth"
model = "gpt-5-mini"

[sandbox]
runtime = "runc"
network_mode = "bridge"
workspace_access = "rw"

[memory]
context_token_budget = 100000
recency_window = 10
extraction_enabled = true

[telegram]
bot_token = "123456789:ABCdef..."
allowed_users = ["@yourusername"]
```

Then authenticate and verify:

```bash
uv run ash auth login
uv run ash config validate
uv run ash doctor
```

## Start By Goal

If you want to:

- Pick model aliases and credential strategy -> [Models](/systems/llm/)
- Understand runtime actions and extension points -> [Tools](/systems/tools/)
- Build reusable workflow automation -> [Skills](/systems/skills/)
- Configure delegated and nested execution -> [Agents](/systems/agents/)
- Tune context and extraction behavior -> [Memory](/systems/memory/)
- Lock down runtime security and mounts -> [Sandbox](/systems/sandbox/)
- Run Telegram and channel delivery -> [Chat Providers](/systems/providers/)
- Enable inbound image handling -> [Vision](/systems/vision/)
- Enable browser-driven workflows -> [Browser](/systems/browser/)

## Troubleshooting

If system behavior is unclear:

```bash
uv run ash config validate
uv run ash doctor
uv run ash logs --component providers
```

Then jump to the specific subsystem page for targeted fixes.

## Reference (Advanced)

Core stack snapshot:

- Language/runtime: Python 3.12+
- CLI: Typer
- Server: FastAPI + Uvicorn
- Validation/modeling: Pydantic
- Container runtime integration: Docker (`docker-py`)
