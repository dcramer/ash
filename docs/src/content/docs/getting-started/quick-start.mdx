Get Ash up and running with these steps.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Docker (for sandboxed command execution)
- An Anthropic or OpenAI API key

## Installation

<Steps>

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dcramer/ash.git
   cd ash
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   uv sync --all-groups
   ```

3. **Set your API key**

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

   Or for OpenAI:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

4. **Run the setup wizard**

   ```bash
   uv run ash setup
   ```

   The wizard creates `~/.ash/config.toml` with your API key and model preferences.

   **Tip:** Choose Haiku as your default model (fast, cost-effective), then add a "sonnet" alias when prompted for complex tasks requiring more reasoning power.

5. **Build the sandbox**

   ```bash
   uv run ash sandbox build
   ```

   This builds the Docker image for secure command execution.

6. **Run database migrations**

   ```bash
   uv run ash upgrade
   ```

</Steps>

## Start Chatting

Interactive mode:

```bash
uv run ash chat
```

Single prompt:

```bash
uv run ash chat "What's the weather like?"
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Use `--no-streaming` if you prefer to see complete responses rather than streaming output.
</Aside>

## Run as a Server

Start the server for Telegram integration:

```bash
uv run ash serve
```

The server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default.
