## Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Python | 3.12+ | Required |
| Docker | 20.10+ | For sandbox execution |
| uv | Latest | Recommended package manager |

## Install from Source

<Steps>

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dcramer/ash.git
   cd ash
   ```

2. **Install with uv**

   ```bash
   uv sync --all-groups
   ```

   This installs all dependencies including development tools.

3. **Verify installation**

   ```bash
   uv run ash --help
   ```

</Steps>

## Environment Variables

Set API keys via environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes* | Anthropic Claude API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes* | OpenAI API key |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | No | Telegram bot token |
| `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` | No | Brave Search API key |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | No | Sentry error tracking DSN |

*At least one LLM provider key is required.

<Aside type="tip">
  API keys can also be set in the configuration file. Environment variables take precedence.
</Aside>

## Configuration

Run the setup wizard to create your configuration:

```bash
uv run ash setup
```

Or generate a template config with sensible defaults:

```bash
uv run ash init
```

Both create `~/.ash/config.toml` with Haiku as default and Sonnet for complex tasks. Just fill in your API key.

You can also create `~/.ash/config.toml` manually:

```toml
[models.default]
provider = "anthropic"
model = "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"
temperature = 0.7
max_tokens = 4096

[models.sonnet]
provider = "anthropic"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
max_tokens = 8192

# Override model for specific skills that need more reasoning power
[skills.debug]
model = "sonnet"

[skills.code-review]
model = "sonnet"
```

See [Configuration Overview](../../configuration/overview/) for all options.

## Docker Sandbox

The sandbox isolates command execution for security. Build the image:

```bash
uv run ash sandbox build
```

Check sandbox status:

```bash
uv run ash sandbox status
```

## Database Setup

Initialize the SQLite database:

```bash
uv run ash upgrade
```

This runs migrations and verifies the sandbox is ready.

## Workspace Setup

Ash uses a workspace directory for personality and user data:

```
~/.ash/workspace/
├── SOUL.md    # Assistant personality
└── USER.md    # User profile (optional)
```

The setup wizard creates these files. Edit `SOUL.md` to customize your assistant's personality.

## Upgrading

Update your installation:

```bash
cd ash
git pull
uv sync --all-groups
uv run ash upgrade
```

The `upgrade` command handles database migrations and sandbox verification.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker not found

Ensure Docker is installed and running:

```bash
docker info
```

### Permission denied

Add your user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and back in for changes to take effect.

### API key errors

Verify your API key is set:

```bash
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

Or check your config file:

```bash
uv run ash config show
```
